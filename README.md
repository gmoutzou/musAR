# musAR

The musAR demo aims to support the personalization of the cultural experience of visitors to museums and exhibitions. In this proposed approach, the use of Multi-Agent Systems will ensure the flexibility and reliability of the system, effective coordination and control of the information flow, and effective support for the adaptability of information. In addition, the new dimension of interaction of the physical world with the digital content as a result of the use of Augmented Reality technology combined with the provision of personalized information increases the visitor's satisfaction and as a consequence, contributes to the building of a composed cultural experience.
